# SmartRC
Android controlled Arduino based bluetooth smart RC vehicles.
WiFi FPV supported using a webcam, Raspberry Pi and Motion CCTV software.

Includes:
Android app for controlling device via bluetooth, recieveing sensor data and video feed and an Arduino sketch for recieving and executing commands as well as interfacing with onboard sensors and communicating via a HC-06 Bluetooth transciever.

Android app forked from Google's BluetoothChat example app and Arduino Sketch uses 
Servo, DHT and CS_MQ7 Libraries, which are all optional addons for extra equiptment.

With it being Arduino based, the vehicles are completely customisable in terms of software via the sketch and also hardware.
